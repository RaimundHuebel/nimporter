# Nim (programming language)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_(programming_language)

Nim (formerly named Nimrod) is an imperative, general-purpose, multi-paradigm, statically typed, systems,
compiled programming language[6] designed and developed by Andreas Rumpf. It is designed to be "efficient,
expressive, and elegant",[7] supporting metaprogramming, functional, message passing,[4] procedural,
and object-oriented programming styles by providing several features such as compile time code generation,
algebraic data types, a foreign function interface (FFI) with C and C++, and compiling to C, C++,
Objective-C, and JavaScript.
